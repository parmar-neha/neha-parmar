Hello, I'm Neha.

I am a UX Designer and For me, design is a tool to make sense of complexities, examine user behaviors and reactions, and create intuitive experiences that integrate naturally in people's lives.I'm intrigued by the formation of preferences and habits, and the process of fulfilling what people desire beyond just the surface. My background as a Customer Support Engineer has taught me the importance of empathy and attention to detail, which Iâ€™ve combined with my user experience skills. 


Outside of design, I enjoy Music, Reading, Fashion Designing and Trying new recipes . Like a great chef, my specialty is UX design, but I'm not afraid to try new recipes! I love to explore new things and try to fill every day with laughter. I believe the best experiences are those shared with others, and I want my designs to impact those special social interactions.


Thanks for stopping by!
